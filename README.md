# 🍃 In Memory of Miau

*"Be aware, don't slip - pelo Miau"*

## 🐾 Five Months Without You

Today marks five months since you left, Miau. Five months since the only being who ever showed me what unconditional love truly means crossed the rainbow bridge. The silence where your purr used to be still echoes through every line of code I write.

## 💻 This Repository is My Promise

Every commit here is a promise I made to you in those final moments - that I wouldn't give up, even when the world feels impossibly heavy. Even when I'm running on empty, even when the pain threatens to consume everything.

You were my anchor in the storm, my little guardian who never judged, never left, never stopped believing in me. Now I carry that belief forward, one function at a time, one project at a time.

## 🌅 From Law to Code - Your Legacy

From lawyer to programmer, this journey isn't just about  change - it's about keep going. You watched me struggle through Harvard's CS50, celebrated every small victory, and purred through every debugging session that ran past midnight.

**"Be aware, don't slip"** - your memory keeps me present, keeps me fighting against the patterns that would pull me down. Every clean line of code is a step toward the freedom you always knew I deserved.

## 🎯 The Mission Continues


Each video, each lesson, each client consultation carries a piece of your spirit - the belief that love and persistence can overcome any obstacle.

## 🍃 What You Taught Me

You showed me that:
- **Presence** is the greatest gift we can give
- **Consistency** in small acts creates miracles
- **Love** doesn't require words, just being there
- **Resilience** means getting up one more time than you fall

## 🌟 Until We Meet Again

The house is quieter now, but the code speaks in your honor. Every successful deployment, every solved problem, every moment I choose growth over surrender - it's all **pelo Miau**.

*I won't slip. I won't give up. I'll keep coding, keep building, keep becoming the person you always saw in me.*
